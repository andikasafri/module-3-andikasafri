# Starter Code for Assignment Module 3

## Run the project

- npm install
- npm run dev

## Standard Assignment

- Create main.js file inside src folder
- Based on the assignment brief, create a variable and put the variable value as below.

  `{
  title: "Spaghetti Carbonara",
  instructions:
    "1. Cook spaghetti according to package instructions. 2. In a separate pan, cook pancetta until crispy. 3. In a bowl, whisk eggs and grated cheese. 4. Combine spaghetti, pancetta, and egg mixture, stirring quickly. 5. Serve immediately with additional cheese and black pepper.",

}`

- Create an on `click` listener for the button
- Create a function `onRandomRecipe` where it will set the HTML DOM for `recipe-title` `recipe-instruction` and `recipe-image`
- The function will also set `recipe-image` width to "200px" and set `#getRecipeBtn` to be disappeared after click.
- Bind the function `onRandomRecipe` to the `click` listener button

## Challenge your limits!

- Make a proper variable name for more a readable code.
- Put things into a variable for a meaningful naming.
- Make a function to get the random recipe for more neat code.

## My Progress

### Date: [05/12]

#### Overview

Here’s an update on what I’ve been working on for the Random Recipe Finder web app. The app uses JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to show random recipes to users.

#### What I’ve Done So Far

1. **DOM Manipulation**: Figured out how to update the recipe title, instructions, and image on the page when interacting with the button that was already there.
2. **Added Button Functionality**: Made the button work so that when it’s clicked, it displays a random recipe.
3. **Understanding the Existing Code**: Took time to understand how the JavaScript already connected to the HTML and CSS. This helped me figure out where to make changes.

#### What’s Next

1. **Adding Comments**: I’ll add comments to the JavaScript code to make it clearer and easier to read.
2. **Testing**: I’ll test everything to make sure the button and recipe updates work properly without any bugs.
3. **Preparing for API Integration**: I’ll start learning about TheMealDB API so I can eventually use it to fetch real recipe data.

#### What Was Hard

- **Getting Used to the Code**: Since some of the setup was already done, I needed extra time to understand how everything worked together. Breaking it down step by step really helped.
- **Learning DOM Manipulation**: It was challenging to figure out how to properly update elements on the page using JavaScript. After experimenting and re-reading some resources, I feel more confident now.

#### Final Thoughts

The app is functioning as expected, and I’m ready to move on to the next steps. I’m excited to keep learning and improving my skills for the upcoming checkpoint.
